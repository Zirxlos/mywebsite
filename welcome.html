    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p class="welcome">
        I am Shawn Ives, a trained material scientist who wants to move to the world of IT. I have always been interest in CS
    and always was trying to troubleshoot my computer from a young age. During my studies, I had experience with some
    scientifical programming language like Maple and Scilab and I was always keen on using them in university projects.
    Somehow, I did not make the connection yet that I really enjoyed programming.
    </p>
    <p class="welcome">
        Since the beginning of the year I have been learning a lot about CS thanks to Harvard's introduction to computer science and I have been working on many assignments.
    </p>
    <p class="welcome">
        I am now completing further education at the International Hochschule (IU) and working on two projects there:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>One using Python with Object Orientation</li>
        <li>And the other design a database with SQL</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="welcome">
        I am very excited to continue this journey and start using everything I have learned in the working place and keeping on learning more.
    </p>
