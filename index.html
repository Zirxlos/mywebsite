            <p>I am Shawn, originally a ceramic material science engineer who always has been into IT and somehow never took the step to get into it.</p>
            <p>
                After some self introspection, I decided to get into it and started learning with different online platforms. I will keep on this page a collection of where I have learnt things, what I think about them
                and hopefully later on, some of the projects I have completed and use this page as a portfolio.

            <h2>Where did I learn to code?</h2>
            <h3>Introduction to CS50 by Harvard ond edX</h3>
            <p>
                This online course is amazing. It get you started into some coding with the right amount of holding your hand. The start is very beginner friendly and you really get into learning proper syntax and 
                good habits without getting lost in setting up any IDE or entering a rabbit hole of details without even starting to code. I am currently not done with the course but slowly reaching the end and 
                I have to say, I really love it.
            </p>
            <h3>freeCodeCamp</h3>
            <p>
                Very solid platform up until now. I did not do much in the direction of languages like python or javascript on it, but it gave me the bases for HTML and CSS. It takes you pretty much by the hand for 
                the learning projects and the certification projects are rapidely scary and "difficult" to finish. But through this project, you search more ressources online and finally learn more than on the 
                learning projects. I would recommend to first start with CS50 though, as freeCodeCamp can be overwhelming with the freedom.
            </p>
            <h3>DataCamp</h3>
            <p>
                Alright, DataCamp. This one is maybe out of context compared to the two others. It is really targeted towards data science and it is not for free (about 40$ per month). But you get to learn many functions 
                and libraries from python. Even if some libraries are very data science specific, you get to learn something more and their video lessons are in a short digestible format followed by some exercises which 
                get you coding what you have just learned. Maybe they take your hand a bit too much but in between some more challenging lessons on other platforms, it allows me to give my brain a rest while still learning.
