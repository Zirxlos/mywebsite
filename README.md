## My Website

On this repo, I am building a website using HTML and CSS (maybe JS later as well) to talk about my journey while learning coding and some of my projects.
Eventually, I will use it as a platform to talk about programming and other topics I enjoy.

To access the website, follow this link: https://zirxlos.github.io/mywebsite/
