            <h3>Introduction to CS50 by Harvard ond edX</h3>
            <p class="journey">
                This online course is amazing. It get you started into some coding with the right amount of holding your
                hand. The start is very beginner friendly and you really get into learning proper syntax and
                good habits without getting lost in setting up any IDE or entering a rabbit hole of details without even
                starting to code. I am currently not done with the course but slowly reaching the end and
                I have to say, I really love it.
            </p>
            <h3>freeCodeCamp</h3>
            <p class="journey">
                Very solid platform up until now. I did not do much in the direction of languages like python or javascript
                on it, but it gave me the bases for HTML and CSS. It takes you pretty much by the hand for
                the learning projects and the certification projects are rapidely scary and "difficult" to finish. But
                through this project, you search more ressources online and finally learn more than on the
                learning projects. I would recommend to first start with CS50 though, as freeCodeCamp can be overwhelming
                with the freedom.
            </p>
            <h3>IU Akademie</h3>
            <p class="journey">
                I started several learning modules at the IU Akademie, a platform offered by the IU Internationale Hochschule,
                an online university in Germany which provide further education. With these modules, I have deepened
                my understanding of SQL and Python thanks to the two projects I had to do.
            </p>
            <h3>DataCamp</h3>
            <p class="journey">
                Alright, DataCamp. This one is maybe out of context compared to the two others. It is really targeted
                towards data science and it is not for free (about 40$ per month). But you get to learn many functions
                and libraries from python. Even if some libraries are very data science specific, you get to learn something
                more and their video lessons are in a short digestible format followed by some exercises which
                get you coding what you have just learned. Maybe they take your hand a bit too much but in between some more
                challenging lessons on other platforms, it allows me to give my brain a rest while still learning.
